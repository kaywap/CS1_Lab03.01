This is the "Very Fun Platformer Game". As you can tell from the name, it's very fun! You can use WASD or arrow keys to move (you can also use the space bar if you feel like it). In the game, there will be many game pieces like the pink bouncepad that launches you in the air, the gray spikes and blue enemies that will kill you, and green moving platforms that move back and forth. My favorite movement mechanic in this game is the wall jumping and sliding. if you go up against a wall and jump, you can continuously wall jump. If you are sliding down a wall, you fall slower (Mr. Cochran, this is my extra). I also added different poses the player is in based on what they are doing. If they are moving right/left, the player looks like they are running. If they are jumping, the position changes, and if they are standing still, they will be in the default idle position. Also, here is a video explaining my game and some of its code: https://www.loom.com/share/4ef446ead62a44388405ac948bfa17ea?sid=879bc66a-654c-46b6-b9fa-f9fd91e1c2aa. Thanks for reading and enjoy the game!
